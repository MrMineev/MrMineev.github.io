(i.e. highlighting the smallest prime divisor, etc) I notice that the problem is very
                                                                  

                                                                  
similar to a problem I solved on AoPS recently, thus I applied the same trick and
obtained the exact form of the numbers described in the problem statement. Since, if
we consider
   <div class="math-display" >
<img 
src="main26x.png" alt="d = --n-- =&#x21D2;  d+ 1 = --n--+ 1
    2v2(n)            2v2(n)
" class="math-display" ></div>
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   we obtain a number which does not have any common prime factors with <img 
src="main27x.png" alt="n  " class="math">,
however it is also even, consequently not prime, thus it must be that <img 
src="main28x.png" alt="n  " class="math"> is of the
form <img 
src="main29x.png" alt=" &#x03B1; &#x03B2;
2 (2 - 1)+ 1  " class="math">. From here solving the problem is trivial, however I somehow
overlooked this trivial idea and moved on.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   I realized that it is simple to show by considering the smallest prime that <img 
src="main30x.png" alt="n  " class="math"> is
not only even, but also divisible by <img 
src="main31x.png" alt="4  " class="math">. I assumed that <img 
src="main32x.png" alt="8 | n  " class="math"> and noticed
that implies that <img 
src="main33x.png" alt="9 | n =&#x21D2; 3 | n  " class="math">. Now I realized I can generate a lot of
primes,
   <div class="math-display" >
<img 
src="main34x.png" alt="8>
<  8 | n &#x2227; 3 | n = &#x21D2; 24 | n =&#x21D2; 25 | n =&#x21D2; 5 | n
>: 3 | n &#x2227; 5 | n = &#x21D2; 15 | n =&#x21D2; 16 | n
  16 | n &#x2227; 3 | n = &#x21D2; 48 | n =&#x21D2; 49 | n =&#x21D2; 7 | n
" class="math-display" ></div>
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Now, this is where I noticed that <img 
src="main35x.png" alt="5 &#x2261; 2 (mod  3)  " class="math"> and <img 
src="main36x.png" alt="7 &#x2261; 1 (mod 3)  " class="math">.
Consequently either <img 
src="main37x.png" alt="5 &#x22C5;2v2(n) + 1  " class="math"> or <img 
src="main38x.png" alt="7&#x22C5;2v2(n) + 1  " class="math"> is divisible by <img 
src="main39x.png" alt="3  " class="math">, thus not
prime. Since (it is simple to show by considering the <img 
src="main40x.png" alt="2v2(n)  " class="math">) that <img 
src="main41x.png" alt="2v2(n)  " class="math"> must be
larger than the largest odd divisor of <img 
src="main42x.png" alt="n  " class="math"> we obtain a contradiction! Careful analysis
concludes four edge cases <img 
src="main43x.png" alt="1,2,4,12  " class="math">. <img 
src="main44x.png" alt="&#x25A0; " class="math">
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   After solving the problem in this beautiful way I thought that the other
contestants would find this problem difficult, however due to me missing a
trivial idea after obtaining the form of <img 
src="main45x.png" alt="n  " class="math"> it lead to develop this interesting
proof.

neccesary by induction. I solved it during the contest, but it took me way too much
