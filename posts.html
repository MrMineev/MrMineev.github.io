<i>On the circumference of a circle there are red and blue points. One may add a red point and change the colour of both its neighbours (to the other colour) or remove a red point and change the colour of both its previous neighbours. Initially there are two red points. Prove that there is no sequence of allowed operations which leads to the configuration consisting of two blue points.</i>
<br>
<br>
There are two beautiful in their own way solutions, here I will present both of those solutions, one will have group-theoretic origins whilst the other will stem from pure combinatorial conclusions.
<br>
<br>
<b>Combinatorial Approach:</b> Suppose \(B_1, \ldots B_n\) are the blue points on the circle, and let \(a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n\) represent the number of red points between \(B_i\) and \(B_{i + 1}\). Then, let us call the following quantity the characteristic of the state,
$$C = a_1 - a_2 + \ldots - a_n$$
Then it is not difficult to check that this value remains invariant under the operations, however is different at the start and at the end, contradiction!
<br>
<br>
<b>Group-theoretic Approach:</b> Let us consider the <i>Dihedral group</i> of a \(3\)-gon (a order \(6\) group), let \(r\) and \(s\) be its generators, the group will consist of \(6\) elements, \(\{1, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2\}\). Let us notice that the following identities hold,
$$rrr = ss \impliedby r^3 = 1 = s^2$$
$$rrs = sr \impliedby r^2s^2 = srs = r^{-1}$$
$$srr = rs \impliedby s^2r^2 =srs =r^{-1}$$
$$srs = rr \impliedby r^2 = r^{-1}$$
Let us assume \(r\) is red and \(s\) is blue, as you can see from these four examples, the exact operations described in the problem statement are actually simply identities in $D_6$. Thus, a simple idea, which naturally follows out of this is to consider the product of all the values around the circle (meaning, a product of some $r$-s and $s$-s), then due to the operation keeping this product the same, we have identified an extremely useful invariant. All that is left to notice is that $r^2 = r_{-1} \neq 1$, however $s^2 = 1$, thus it is impossible to get from one state to the other simply through applying the operations outlined in the problem statement.

Happy New Year! 🎉 Here's to a great 2025, a year full of fascinating mathematical facts:

<br>
<br>
1. \(2025 = 45^2 = (1 + 2 + \ldots + 9)^2\)  
<br>  
2. \(2025 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + 9^3\)  
<br>  
3. \(2025\) is the sum of all numbers in a \(9 \times 9\) multiplication table.  
<br>  
4. \(2025\) is a Harshad number, divisible by the sum of its digits (9).  
<br>  
5. You can write \(2025\) using just \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\): \(2025 = 1 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^2\).  
<br>  
6. Adding 1 to each digit of \(2025\) gives \(3136\) (a square). Changing one digit gives another square: \(3025\).  
<br>  
7. There are \(2025\) numbers from \(1\) to \(9999\) where the last digit is greater than all previous digits.  
<br>  
8. Fun fact: \(27^2 + 36^2 = 2025\).  
<br>  
9. \(2025\) is the sum of two triangular numbers (\(\frac{44 \cdot 45}{2}\) and \(\frac{45 \cdot 46}{2}\)). Also, splitting \(2025\) into \(20\) and \(25\) gives \(45\), which is triangular and the square root of \(2025\).  
<br>  
10. \(2025 = (20 + 25) \cdot (20 + 25)\).  
<br>

      Came across a simple problem which yeilds a beautiful result.

      <br>
      <br>

      <i>A robot is randomly walks \(K\) steps in a square grid, what is the expected distance from the origin?</i>

      <br>
      <br>

      We can first solve the one dimentional case, let \(\gamma\) be a random variable representing the distance from the robot at the end til the origin, then,

      $$\mathbb{E} \gamma = \mathbb{E} | \sum_{i = 1}^K a_i |$$
      
      where \(a_i\) is the random variable representing the \(i\)-th step. However, working with the module is difficult thus, we can take a simpler approach by calculating the following value,

      $$\mathbb{E} \gamma^2 = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{i = 1}^K (\text{one step}) \right] ^ 2 = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{i = 1}^K a_i^2 + \sum_{i \neq j} a_i a_j \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{i = 1}^K a_i^2 \right] + \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{i \neq j} a_i a_j \right]$$

      Notice, that,

      $$\mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{i \neq j} a_i a_j \right] = \sum_{i \neq j} \mathbb{E} \left[ a_i a_j \right] = 0$$

      Thus,
      
      $$\mathbb{E} \gamma^2 = \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{i = 1}^K a_i^2 \right] = K$$ 

      Thus, $$\mathbb{E} \gamma = \sqrt{K}$$

      Perfect! One can do the exact same in two dimentions, let \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) the number of steps used for the X and Y axis respectively, then,

      $$\mathbb{E} \gamma^2 = \mathbb{E} \left[ (\sqrt{K_1})^2 + (\sqrt{K_2})^2 \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ K_1 + K_2 \right] = K$$

      Thus, \(\mathbb{E} \gamma = \sqrt{K}\).

      I realized, that the geometry problem I have suggest on September 7, could be solved much simpler, without finding similar triangles or calculating angles. Here I will give a rough outline of the new proof.<br>
      Let \(N\) and \(K\) move linearly, \(N(t) = \vec{C} + t\vec{CB}\) and \(K(t) = \vec{B} + t\vec{BC}\). Notice, when \(t = 0\), \(N = C\) and \(B = K\), consequently \(M = H\). When, \(t = 1\), \(C = K\) and \(B = N\), consequently \(M = A\). Due to \(M\) moving linearly as well, we see, that \(M\) moves on \(AH\), then one must simply prove the statement backwards and done!

      Let us define $f(n)$ to be the mathematical expectation of the smallest prime divisor (or similarly just, smallest divisor greater than 1) of a uniformly chosen random number from 2 to \(n\). Then, let \(\pi_n\) represent the probability of \(p_n\) being the smallest prime divisor. Then,
      <br>

$$\pi_n = \frac{1}{p_n}\left( 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \pi_i \right)$$

And we can express the expectation as follows,

$$f(n) = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{k} n \pi_i p_i \right] / n = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \pi_i p_i$$
$$\pi_3 = \frac{1}{p_3}\left( 1- \frac{1}{p_2} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p_1} \right) \right)$$

It is not hard to see that, indeed, the following holds,

$$\pi_n = \frac{\phi(P_{n-1})}{P_n}$$

where \(P_n\) represents the \(n\)-th primorial number (\(p_1 p_2 \ldots p_n\)). Thus,

      I came across an interesting topic: <a href="https://oeis.org/A006521">Novak numbers</a>. A Novak number is a number \(n\) which satisfies the following property:
$$n | 2^n + 1$$
This sequence has many intriguing properties, one of the most remarkable being its infiniteness. This is quite peculiar considering the fact that there are no natural numbers, greater than 1, such that \( n | 2^n - 1 \), which is a straightforward consequence of Fermat's Little Theorem. I plan to discuss these properties in more detail in a future article.
<br>
Interestingly, there was a problem related to this topic in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in 2000. The problem is as follows:

<br>
<br>

<b>Statement:</b> <i>Does there exist a positive integer \(n\) such that \(n\) has exactly 2000 distinct prime divisors and \(n\) divides \(2^n + 1\)?</i>

<br>

<a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2000_IMO_Problems/Problem_5">Problem Statement and Solution</a>

<br>
<br>


Simply knowing about the existence of Novak numbers provides an intuitive answer of "yes," due to the fact that there are infinitely many of them. While this is not a formal proof, it certainly offers valuable insight and perspective on the problem.

        Consider a set of \(n\) states, along with two terminal states \(n + 1\) and \(n + 2\). A machine starts at state \(1\), and then every second switches states based on some probability distribution \(p_{ij}\), which represents the probability of switching from state \(i\) to state \(j\). The machine stops the process when it has reached a terminal state. Calculate the probability it will reach state \(n + 1\).
      </div>
      A cool method I have found, is instead of trying to find a direct way to calculate the probability, write down \(n\) equations involving \(n\) unknowns and there values.
      Let us denote by \(P(s)\) the probability of getting to state \(n + 1\) in the end, then it is trivial to understand the following equation.
      $$P(1) = p_{11}P(1) + p_{12}P(2) + p_{13}P(3) + ... + p_{1n}P(n)$$
      Writing down the same equation for \(P(2), P(3), ..., P(n)\) gives the following.
      $$0 = (p_{11} - 1)P(1) + p_{12}P(2) + p_{13}P(3) + ... + p_{1n}P(n)$$
      $$0 = p_{21}P(1) + (p_{22} - 1)P(2) + p_{23}P(3) + ... + p_{2n}P(n)$$
      $$...$$
      $$0 = p_{n1}P(1) + p_{n2}P(2) + p_{n3}P(3) + ... + (p_{nn} - 1)P(n)$$
      Solving this system of linear equations will give the precise formula for \(P(s)\), obviously the answer will be \(P(1)\).

      Fun problem from <i>IMO - 2008.2</i>, which can be solved using Symmetric Polynomials and then methods mentioned in my <a href="articles/symmetric-polynomials/symmetric_polynomials.html">article</a>.

      <br>
      <i>Problem Statement (<a href="https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2008SL.pdf">IMO Shortlist 2008 with this solution)</a>: </i>

        Prove that for any for any
        $$x, y, z \neq 1$$
        satisfying the condition
        $$xyz = 1$$
        the following inequality holds.
        $$\frac{x^2}{(x - 1)^2} + \frac{y^2}{(y - 1)^2} + \frac{z^2}{(z - 1)^2} \geq 1$$
      </div>
      <br>
      First let us substitue \(a = \frac{x}{x - 1}, b = \frac{y}{y - 1}, c = \frac{z}{z - 1}\). Then the condition \(xyz = 1\) provided can be written down as the following.
      $$abc = \frac{x}{x - 1} \cdot \frac{y}{y - 1} \cdot \frac{z}{z - 1}$$
      $$ = \frac{1}{x - 1} \cdot \frac{1}{y - 1} \cdot \frac{1}{z - 1}$$
      $$ = (a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1)$$
      <br>
      Opening up the brackets you get the following.
      $$abc = abc - ab - ac - bc + a + b + c - 1$$
      $$e_1 = e_2 + 1$$
      Now let us play around with the inequality we need to prove.
      $$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = e_1^2 - 2e_2 = e_1^2 - 2e_1 + 2 = (e_1 - 1)^2 + 1$$
      Which obviously is greater than 1. Thus concluding the proof.
